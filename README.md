    * Overview of the [course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/)
        * Slack
        * git
        * GitHub
            * Issues
            * Pull Request
            * Pages

        * (GitLab)
        * Markdown (journal, issues, etc.)
        * Docker

        * Personal web site
        * Issues (tickets) opened on various projects
        * Pull-Requests sent to various projects
        * Development of a personal open source project

* About myself:
    * Self employed
    * Training
    * Introducing testing, CI etc. to teams in corporations.

* Assignments:
    * Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories.
    * At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
    * You will add the link of your blog post to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)
    * Video timstamping: Every week two people have to "timestamp" the videos. You can pick a video you'd like to do. If noone volunteers to do one of the videos I'll pick from the names so by the end of the semester everyone will do approximately the same number of videos.
    * First few assignments will be to my projects. This allows for quick feedback and integration.
    * Then to each others projects. This still allows for quick feedback.
    * Then we'll find you open source projects maintained by other people. For these I might be able to give feedback, but I cannot integrate them.
* Grades:
    * Grades are based on the work done during the course.
    * There is no end-project or exam at the end.
    * Each week you'll get a grade of 0-100 and we'll have an average of them at the end of the semester.
