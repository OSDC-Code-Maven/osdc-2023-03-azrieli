## Session 1: Welcome, Version Control, Journal, Slack

* Welcome

* About the course:
    * Goal: Become familiar with tools and processes used for software development both in the industry and in the academic institutions through contribution to open source projects.
    * List of tools we learn, they are all used in both academy and corporation, they could be used better in both places.
    * Overview of the [course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/)
        * Slack
        * git
        * GitHub
            * Issues
            * Pull Request
            * Pages
            * Actions
        * (GitLab)
        * Markdown (journal, issues, etc.)
        * Docker
        * Testing
        * Static analysis
    * End results:
        * Blog posts (journal entries)
        * Personal web site
        * Issues (tickets) opened on various projects
        * Pull-Requests sent to various projects
        * Development of a personal open source project

* About myself:
    * Self employed
    * Training
    * Introducing testing, CI etc. to teams in corporations.

* Assignments:
    * Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories.
    * At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
    * You will add the link of your blog post to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)
    * Video timstamping: Every week two people have to "timestamp" the videos. You can pick a video you'd like to do. If noone volunteers to do one of the videos I'll pick from the names so by the end of the semester everyone will do approximately the same number of videos.
    * First few assignments will be to my projects. This allows for quick feedback and integration.
    * Then to each others projects. This still allows for quick feedback.
    * Then we'll find you open source projects maintained by other people. For these I might be able to give feedback, but I cannot integrate them.
* Grades:
    * Grades are based on the work done during the course.
    * There is no end-project or exam at the end.
    * Each week you'll get a grade of 0-100 and we'll have an average of them at the end of the semester.

* How and why to blog/journal?
    * [DEV.to](https://dev.to/)
    * Use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
    * Use visual editor of DEV (Switch at Customization / Writing)
    * Create series.
    * Add `#osdc` tag
    * The importance of linking and link anchors.

* Why use version control?
* What is [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
* Pull request to add JSON, show drawing.
* Use the cm-demo account to add enty to participant.

* About GitHub Actions: they are programs triggered by some action. In this case by a pull request.

* We looked at pypi page of [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* We sent [this Pull-Request](https://github.com/vangheem/mr.flagly/pull/1)

* We found that the [mrflagly](https://pydigger.com/pypi/mrflagly) project was missing the author field from the meta-data.
* We went to its GitHub repository, found that it was using pyproject.toml and found the name and email of the author.
* [pyproject.toml file specification](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/)

* We also looked at [pglib](https://pydigger.com/pypi/pglib) and saw that it is hosted on GitLab.

* The [licenses page](https://pydigger.com/licenses) on PyDigger was [fixed](https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com/commit/bfc242d95e9ae3c968b35b6f0910ad7c8c7ad6af) a few hours before the lecture.
* OSI approved [Open Source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/).
