## Session 1: Welcome, Version Control, Journal, Slack

* Welcome

* About the course:
    * Goal: Become familiar with tools and processes used for software development both in the industry and in the academic institutions through contribution to open source projects.
    * List of tools we learn, they are all used in both academy and corporation, they could be used better in both places.
    * Overview of the [course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/)
        * Slack
        * git
        * GitHub
            * Issues
            * Pull Request
            * Pages
            * Actions
        * (GitLab)
        * Markdown (journal, issues, etc.)
        * Docker
        * Testing
        * Static analysis
    * End results:
        * Blog posts (journal entries)
        * Personal web site
        * Issues (tickets) opened on various projects
        * Pull-Requests sent to various projects
        * Development of a personal open source project

* About myself:
    * Self employed
    * Training
    * Introducing testing, CI etc. to teams in corporations.

* Assignments:
    * Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories.
    * At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
    * You will add the link of your blog post to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)
    * Video timstamping: Every week two people have to "timestamp" the videos. You can pick a video you'd like to do. If noone volunteers to do one of the videos I'll pick from the names so by the end of the semester everyone will do approximately the same number of videos.
    * First few assignments will be to my projects. This allows for quick feedback and integration.
    * Then to each others projects. This still allows for quick feedback.
    * Then we'll find you open source projects maintained by other people. For these I might be able to give feedback, but I cannot integrate them.
* Grades:
    * Grades are based on the work done during the course.
    * There is no end-project or exam at the end.
    * Each week you'll get a grade of 0-100 and we'll have an average of them at the end of the semester.

* How and why to blog/journal?
    * [DEV.to](https://dev.to/)
    * Use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
    * Use visual editor of DEV (Switch at Customization / Writing)
    * Create series.
    * Add `#osdc` tag
    * The importance of linking and link anchors.

* Why use version control?
* What is [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
* Pull request to add JSON, show drawing.
* Use the cm-demo account to add enty to participant.

* About GitHub Actions: they are programs triggered by some action. In this case by a pull request.

* We found that the [mrflagly](https://pydigger.com/pypi/mrflagly) project was missing the author field from the meta-data.
* We went to its GitHub repository, found that it was using pyproject.toml and found the name and email of the author.
* [pyproject.toml file specification](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/)

* We also looked at [pglib](https://pydigger.com/pypi/pglib) and saw that it is hosted on GitLab.

* The [licenses page](https://pydigger.com/licenses) on PyDigger was [fixed](https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com/commit/bfc242d95e9ae3c968b35b6f0910ad7c8c7ad6af) a few hours before the lecture.
* OSI approved [Open Source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/).

## Session 5

Date: 2023.04.13 12:15-14:30

* We need Better projects (e.g. projects you use at your work) we discussed what are GitHub organizations and what are repositories.

* How to update a PR that was not accepted yet.
    * We created a [new PR](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/osdc-2023-03-azrieli/pulls) via the Web interface of GitHub that failed the CI and the owner also commented on it.
    * Then we found the fork and the branch in the fork and updated the file.
    * It automatically updated the PR and started the CI again.

* We discussed [this PR](https://github.com/iterative/dvc-data/pull/340) that needs a fix.

* We discussed (in theory) how to handle a case when we plan to create a change for an open source project that might take us a month.
    * How to avoid breakage caused by changes ceated on the main project that conflict with the change we make.
    * The answer is that we cannot totally avoid those conflicts, but we can reduce their impact by communication and by frequently aligning our work with that of the main branch.
    * I mentioned `rebase`. We will see it in action later.
* We briefly discussed if people get paid for their open source work.

* Ideas for PR besides the one we discussed in the previous session:
    * Makes sure the README (or CONTRIBUTION) file in a project has clear instructions how to set up the local development environment and how to run the tests locally. (pick a project that has no, or very few stars)
    * If you can find any open source project with something you feel you can already fix, feel free to do that.
    * Check out my projects in [szabgab](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [OSDC-Code-Maven](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/) or [Kantoniko](https://github.com/kantoniko/) Feel free to send a PR for them, or even just to discuss open issues.

## Session 8: git-scm on Windows, GitHub contribution workflow

Date: 2023.05.04 12:15-14:30

* git-scm configure the default editor
* Windows install (again), process of clone/fork/pull
* [workflows](https://code-maven.com/slides/git/collection-of-git-workflows)

* git-scm
* ~/.gitconfig      global config
* .git/config       config for each repository

* ssh-keygen
* ls -l ~/.ssh/
* cat ~/.ssh/id_ras.pub

```
git init
git add
git commit
```

* Create repo in GitHub and follow the instructions there to push out the repository

```
git clone
git checkout -b branch-name
git add
git commit
git push


git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout branch-name
git rebase main
git push --force
```

A few notes for he lecture yesterday:

For each thing you change create a separate branch from the default branch (usually "master" or "main").
So for example yesterday Ran Moshe found out that the generate command in the [README](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/open-source-by-organizations) does not work.
First of all Ran, you should have opened the two issues right away

1. with the error message for this command `python generate.py github/bioinform.yaml github/calgaryml.yaml` failing
2. that the python generate.py` is failing that you already opened since then: https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/open-source-by-organizations/issues/79

Then when fixing you create a branch and sent a [PR to fix the first issue](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/open-source-by-organizations/pull/80) and I have accepted it.
Already before I accepted it you could go back to the "main" branch and create a new branch for some other changes you might want to make.

Now that I've already accepted the PR, you can update your main branch from my main branch (as I showed yesterday) and then
1. start your new branch from there.
1. if you already have a branch that you started from main you can rebase that branch to "main" and be up to date (as we saw yesterday)
